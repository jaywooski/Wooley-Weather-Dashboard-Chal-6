# Wooley-Weather-Dashboard-Chal-6

## Description
Here I have created a weather app to check the current weather conditions and future five-day forecast for any given city. As long as you have a city name to provide, you should be able to search the information up. Many styling techniques as well as improvision was utilized in the making of this project. big shoutout to TA Wayne for providing insight and troubleshooting in such short notice. 10/10 would reccomend him as I am convinced he is as good at coding as he is on guitar (with strings of course haha).  

This site uses the OpenWeatherMap API in a couple of fetch functions. A couple issues had risen due to using two different API URL calls. One was used to display the current weather conditions while the other was used for the 5-day forecast. All in all, the code still could use some refactoring, I'm sure, yet it still maintains its functionality with a couple glitches if you run into the issues.

This project myself that perserverance and time management are all apart of this profession. It keeps allowing me to cycle through my emotions as I battle trial and error methods to make functioning code. The key to success is to take a break and work when you can while gradually making progress. It is interesting enough to keep you up al night if you love what you do. However, it is always good to do every action you do in moderation. be mindful of the things ahead but do not ponder too faar ahead as you will overthink yourself.

All in all, this project demonstrates the complete understanding of using the fetch() method to obtain data from an API url. The queries inside the protocol address are what link you to the data you're searching for in the object. You can use many APIs per project and this is a helpful tool to making your site functional while locating various resources available to you for free. Even if the resources are not free, dependent on what you want out of your project, it should be worth it if you find the right thing.
